Customizing and adding mascots
===

To hide the jitterbug controls to stop people pausing it change to this

```html
   <audio autoplay>
   <source src="http://www.directlinkupload.com/uploads/138.199.64.75/jitter.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
   </audio> 
```

===
To customize mascots modify the following values in [javascript](js/scripts.js):

```javascript
    var mascotEnable    = true;
    var mascotPath      = "images/mascots/"
    var mascotList      = [ 'ruri1.png', 'ruri2.png', 'ruri3.png' ];
```
